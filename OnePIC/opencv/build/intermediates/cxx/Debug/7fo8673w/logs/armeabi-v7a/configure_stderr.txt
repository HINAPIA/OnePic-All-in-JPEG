CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  No project() command is present.  The top-level CMakeLists.txt file must
  contain a literal, direct call to the project() command.  Add a line of
  code such as

    project(ProjectName)

  near the top of the file, but after cmake_minimum_required().

  CMake is pretending there is a "project(Project)" command on the first
  line.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Warning:
  Manually-specified variables were not used by the project:

    CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS
    CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
    CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
